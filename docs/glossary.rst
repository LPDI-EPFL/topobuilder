  FORM
    Idealized secondary structure lattice representation of a protein structure.
    FORMS describe a layered topology in which each layer is composed of a defined number of either alpha-helices or hydrogen-bonded beta-strands.
    This compressed definition of the protein space was firstly introduced by Tylor and collaborators :cite:`taylor2002periodic`,
    :cite:`taylor2008prediction`.

  MASTER
    The *Method of Accelerated Search for Tertiary Ensemble Representatives* takes as query a structural fragment composed of one or more disjoint
    segments and provably finds all fragments from a database matching the query to within a given RMSD threshold. :cite:`zhou2015rapid`.

  SKETCH
    3D representation of a protein structure (backbone atoms only) of a FORM.
